# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- I am feeling confident enough! There is so many methods and so many things to try, so I think this will be a matter of continuing to practice and beginning to be confident in what the methods will return.

2. How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- I feel confident in writing my own methods! I am excited to see how much more we can build on top of the methods already given to us in the ruby docs.

3. What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
- I did have a question about a specific method from the Ruby Docs but as I was typing this and trying it, I believe I understand now.

``` ruby
1.round           #=> 1
1.round(2)        #=> 1
15.round(-1)      #=> 20
(-15).round(-1)   #=> -20
```

I wasn't understanding how the argument was coming into play here but I think the examples we're not so great. I think using floats would've been a better example so we can see that it's rounding to 2 decimal points, like  `(2.543).round(2) => 2.54`
